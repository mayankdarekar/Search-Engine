DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software for creating, managing, and querying databases. It ensures data integrity, security, and efficient access.

RELATIONAL DATABASES (SQL):
Based on tables with rows and columns, using Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

POPULAR RDBMS:
- MySQL: Open-source, widely used for web applications
- PostgreSQL: Advanced features, ACID compliance, extensible
- Oracle Database: Enterprise-level with high performance
- Microsoft SQL Server: Integrated with Windows ecosystem
- SQLite: Lightweight, embedded database

SQL FUNDAMENTALS:
- DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
- TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK

KEY CONCEPTS:
1. Normalization: Organizing data to reduce redundancy (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
2. Primary Keys: Unique identifiers for records
3. Foreign Keys: Relationships between tables
4. Indexes: Speed up query performance
5. Transactions: ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
6. Joins: Combine data from multiple tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)

NoSQL DATABASES:
Non-relational databases for unstructured or semi-structured data:

TYPES:
1. Document Stores: MongoDB, CouchDB (JSON-like documents)
2. Key-Value Stores: Redis, DynamoDB (Simple key-value pairs)
3. Column-Family: Cassandra, HBase (Wide-column stores)
4. Graph Databases: Neo4j, ArangoDB (Nodes and relationships)

NoSQL ADVANTAGES:
- Horizontal scalability
- Flexible schemas
- High performance for specific use cases
- Better for big data and real-time applications

DATABASE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Schema design for query patterns
- Denormalization for performance
- Partitioning and sharding for scalability

MODERN DATABASE TRENDS:
- NewSQL: Combines SQL and NoSQL benefits
- Cloud databases: AWS RDS, Azure SQL, Google Cloud SQL
- Time-series databases: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB
- In-memory databases: Redis, Memcached
- Distributed databases: CockroachDB, YugabyteDB

DATABASE SECURITY:
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- SQL injection prevention
- Backup and recovery strategies
- Audit logging

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Query optimization and execution plans
- Indexing strategies
- Caching mechanisms
- Connection pooling
- Database replication and load balancing
