DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

Data structures organize and store data efficiently, while algorithms define step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. Together, they form the foundation of computer science.

FUNDAMENTAL DATA STRUCTURES:
1. Arrays: Fixed-size sequential collections with O(1) access time
2. Linked Lists: Dynamic collections with nodes containing data and pointers
3. Stacks: LIFO (Last In First Out) structure for function calls and undo operations
4. Queues: FIFO (First In First Out) structure for task scheduling
5. Trees: Hierarchical structures including binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees
6. Graphs: Networks of nodes and edges representing relationships
7. Hash Tables: Key-value pairs with average O(1) lookup time
8. Heaps: Complete binary trees for priority queue implementation

ESSENTIAL ALGORITHMS:
SORTING:
- Bubble Sort: O(n²) - Simple but inefficient
- Merge Sort: O(n log n) - Divide and conquer approach
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average - In-place sorting
- Heap Sort: O(n log n) - Using heap data structure

SEARCHING:
- Linear Search: O(n) - Sequential checking
- Binary Search: O(log n) - Requires sorted array

GRAPH ALGORITHMS:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level-order traversal
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Shortest path in weighted graphs
- Bellman-Ford: Handles negative weights

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
Big O notation describes algorithm efficiency:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n log n): Linearithmic time
- O(n²): Quadratic time

APPLICATIONS:
Data structures and algorithms power search engines, social networks, GPS navigation, recommendation systems, and database management.
