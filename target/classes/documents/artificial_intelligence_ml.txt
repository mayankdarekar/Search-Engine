ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING

Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to simulate human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

MACHINE LEARNING TYPES:
1. Supervised Learning:
   - Training with labeled data
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
   - Applications: Spam detection, image classification, price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, recommendation systems

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learning through trial and error with rewards
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradients
   - Applications: Game AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles

DEEP LEARNING:
Neural networks with multiple layers for complex pattern recognition:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Image processing and computer vision
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Sequential data and time series
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Language processing and speech recognition
- Transformers: State-of-the-art NLP models like GPT, BERT

POPULAR AI/ML FRAMEWORKS:
- TensorFlow: Google's open-source ML framework
- PyTorch: Facebook's research-friendly framework
