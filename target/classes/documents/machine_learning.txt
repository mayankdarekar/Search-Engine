Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and make predictions. Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Popular libraries include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
