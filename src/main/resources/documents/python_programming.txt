PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Known for its clean syntax and readability, Python emphasizes code simplicity and developer productivity.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Readable Syntax: Uses indentation for code blocks, making it beginner-friendly
- Dynamic Typing: Variable types are determined at runtime
- Interpreted Language: No compilation step required
- Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for various domains
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more

PYTHON PARADIGMS:
1. Procedural Programming: Sequential execution of instructions
2. Object-Oriented Programming: Classes and objects for code organization
3. Functional Programming: First-class functions and lambda expressions

POPULAR LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS:
- Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Web Development: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- Automation: Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Scrapy

USE CASES:
Python excels in data analysis, machine learning, web development, automation scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence research. It's the language of choice for data scientists and AI engineers.

PYTHON VERSIONS:
Python 3.x is the current standard, with Python 3.10+ offering improved performance and new features like structural pattern matching.
