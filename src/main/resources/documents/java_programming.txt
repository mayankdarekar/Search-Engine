JAVA PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any platform supporting Java without recompilation.

KEY FEATURES:
- Platform Independence: Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enables cross-platform execution
- Object-Oriented: Everything is an object, promoting code reusability
- Automatic Memory Management: Garbage collection handles memory deallocation
- Strong Type Checking: Compile-time error detection enhances reliability
- Multithreading Support: Built-in support for concurrent programming
- Rich Standard Library: Extensive APIs for networking, I/O, collections, and more

CORE CONCEPTS:
1. Classes and Objects: Blueprints and instances of real-world entities
2. Inheritance: Code reuse through parent-child relationships
3. Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding
4. Encapsulation: Data hiding using access modifiers
5. Abstraction: Hiding implementation details

POPULAR FRAMEWORKS:
- Spring Boot: Microservices and web applications
- Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM)
- Apache Struts: Web application framework
- JavaFX: Desktop application development

APPLICATIONS:
Java powers enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, web servers, embedded systems, and big data technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
